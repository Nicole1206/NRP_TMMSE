# NRP_TMMSE

This is the Matlab code to implement NRP-TMMSE algorithm proposed by "Ke et al (2017), Noise Reduction Preprocessing-based Fully Automatic Diagonal Loading Method for Robust Adaptive Beamforming". A few examples can be viewed in the root directory.

PROCEDURE:
1. Run cvx_setup in the Matlab commend window.
2. Run any of the three examples, i.e., Main_VersusM.m, Main_VersusSnapshot, or Main_VersusSNR, to observe the values of diagonal loading level as well as the output SINR of different algorithms w.r.t. the corresponding parameter, respectively.
3. Enjoy yourself!
